                <p>It's been a while since I was able to practice some coding - but for a good reason! I just finished a large interactice media art installation, funded by the UNESCO City of Media Arts Karlsruhe!</p>
              
                <p>This is a little warm-up site exercise to get back into it, and refresh some things in my mind.</p>

                <p> To do: a LOT! such as centering, proper layout, proper design, getting further ahead in the mdn chapters, and more!</p>

            What can the future look like? The installation Between Dreams and Reality shows the hybrid world of man and machine and
            deals in an abstract way with the interplay between the conscious and the unconscious, questions about the future and
            dystopias vs. utopias.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Dream Machine in the center of the installation shows an interplay of the combination of man and machine, technology
            and nature, organic and synthetic and asks questions of the viewer. The artist deals with the following questions, among
            others, but invites the viewer to work out their own questions: To what extent and to what degree are these combinations
            of nature and technology desirable? How do we ourselves feel about it? Artificial intelligence, technology, access to
            information and theories, control, surveillance, capitalism. Where are the boundaries between dystopia and utopia? What
            does the changing times bring? In which direction are we going? Can the direction be changed?
          </p> 

          <p>
            The spatial design is created in collaboration with the artist Desirée Eppele. It shows a synergy of the two artists,
            carrying the theme of the sculpture at the center, out into the extended space. Desirée Eppele translates the surreal
            vision into a large mural-like painting, capturing Beings found running through fleeting subconscious visions. The
            dreamlike environment of the room, as extension of the dream machine, resembles a journey through one’s own
            subconscious, in which various aspects are combined through the visual design as well as the materials used.
