    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    
    <article>
      <p>This is to test a few things using pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. Should it feature a Lorem Ipsum text or just continue somehow and somewhat to see how much text would fill the first line in order to experiment with the MDN examples of first-line and first-paragraph pseudo calsses and elements? 
        What does this kind of linebreak do, if it doesn't include a br? 
        Is it just more ledgible here, and not in the browser, as I assume? Actually yeah, thinking back to the basics, it shouldn't to anything and just continue onwards in a nice straight line.
        Talking of browser...what about Bowser? Is that where the name came from? Should I google that? Maybe trying to finish some things when tired isn't the very best idea. Hohum let's see. Well it appears as if at least the first line of my monitor is now filled, I hope yours too (unless you have a very fancy, super vide monitor or crazy setup that ranges across many fancy monitors making them look like one huge thing - which would be awesome and I'd love to see it!)
      </p>

      <p>YAY it works! Great! More tomorrow...</p>

      <p>Also, I've managed to back onboard and finish not one, but TWO MDN CSS chapters, so wohoo! :D And it's time to sleep now.</p>
